# RecyclingMachine
Python Recycling Machine Based on OOPS Concepts.

#Assignment Overview

You are tasked with creating a text-based program for simulating a Recycling Machine using the Python 3 programming language. 
The assignment is broken up into four main components: 
1.)	Design and model two classes: RecyclableItem and RecyclingMachine,

2.)	Create an activity chart which describes the behaviour of the Recycling Machine system, 

3.)	Create a computer program that allows a user to enter items that are able to be recycled into a machine.  During the process the machine prompts the user for the type of item to be recycled and how many they have to enter. The machine keeps track of the number of each of the different items and keeps track of the total amount to pay the user until they indicate that they are finished.  When they stop adding items, print out a receipt and given them the amount of money owing. The receipt should contain the following:
a.	A list showing how many of each item has deposited and the cost of each item.
b.	The total amount provided for each item
c.	The total money received.

4.)	Finally, explain and integrate some code into your Recycling Machine program that keeps track of how many items of each type are in the machine, and, if the machine is full, makes deposits of that item type unavailable. You machine should have at least 4 different products, and allow up to 50 of each product.
